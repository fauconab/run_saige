# run_saige
Use this set of scripts to run saige in a singularity image (specifically formatted for Davis Lab use)
You will need to update paths in Saige_EUR_perC.sh to be specific to your paths. 
You will also need to update the slurm information to your information (your name, email, and lab probably "davis_lab"

to run this, as long as you have execute permission (chmod +x run.sh) you can simply type ./run.sh to start the run.
If you need to run a single chromosome you can do this by changing to for i in {1,} format. 

Please ask if you need help getting this running! -Annika
